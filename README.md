Using LLM and Cloud Computing tools to enjoy productivity increments during 7 minute Bluey episodes

## The hardware stack
Anyone spending time with children knows, deep in their ancestral knowledge, that revealing a laptop keyboard will ensure an "orange juice incident". Therefore, any progress will come from your phone screen. Alas, coding from one of those keyboards is a farcical practice in absurdity. Fortunately, the Large Language Models are now able to write passible code snippets, with careful advice and kindly reminders. 
A phone won't do much general computing or give you a pleasant shell experience, but my hope is that modern cloud computing services can be orchestrated with modern devops tooling.

Please remember that the voice you use with your young AI is the voice that a mature AI will use with you someday!
